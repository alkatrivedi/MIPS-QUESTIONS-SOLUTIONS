There are following three errors in this program:

ERROR-1. blez $t2, exit
The error is in LINE 23 where there is a conditional statement bneq it will check whether the value of the register $t2 is less than or equal to zero not.
So, when the value of $t2 will become zero it will execute exit function. So, one output will not outputted which will Result=58.
So, instead of doing this we should use bltz.

ERROR-2. add $t1, $t1, 1
The error is in LINE 38 where it is $t1 by 1 with using add which is not correct. Add uses three register it can't immediately add any numerical digit to the register.
Also, we are working with numerical values so, instead of using add use addi and increase $t1 by 4 every time loop execute.

ERROR-3. jr $ra
The error is in line 42 where it execute jump register. There is no need of doing that we should terminate the program execution in exit function.
